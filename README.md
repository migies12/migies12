# 💫 About Me:

I am Miguel Menard, a full-time student at the University of British Columbia in Computer Engineering.

I'm currently doing full-stack development for OnTheSpot!! --> https://www.onthespotvip.com
I am learning Machine learning and AI in my free time
I have an avid interest in Biotech, but I am generally fascinated by the multiple applications of artificial intelligence.

My GitHub is mostly used for my school projects as most of my work has private source code. You can also find some older repositories I worked on when I started coding at 17 years old and also a fun project from a previous hackathon I did.

If you want to contact me for anything please feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn, I am actively looking for a 12-month coop internship starting in May 2025.
